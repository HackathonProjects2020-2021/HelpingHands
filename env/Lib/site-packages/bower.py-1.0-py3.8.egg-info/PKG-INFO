Description: The Laughing Robot
        ------------------
        
        
        Or, how I learned not to rewrite bower in Python.
        
        To answer the first, obvious question:
        
            *Why?*
        
            To allow Python developers/users access to bower components without 
            requiring a node.js / npm infrastructure.
        
        Very basic usage is implemented:
        
          bower.py install <package> [version]
        
        No dependencies are handled. Versions must be pinned.
        
        
        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        This will work, preferably installed into a virtualenv::
        
           pip install bower.py
           bower.py <command>
        
        This is even more self-contained::
        
           pip install vex
           vex -m bower pip install bower.py
           vex bower bower.py <command>
        
        
        Things I Learned About Bower
        ----------------------------
        
        1. bower supports git, svn, http static files, but in reality it supports
           github.com
        2. bower "packages" don't even need to supply a bower.json
